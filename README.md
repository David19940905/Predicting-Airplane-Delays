# Flight Delays ML Pipeline

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict and analyze airline flight delays.  
It includes data preparation, visualization, and model training in Jupyter Notebooks.

---

## ✈️ Overview
The workflow includes:
1. Data loading and cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Model training and evaluation  

You can use this to study which factors (like weather, time, or airline) cause delays.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### Option 1 – Local setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate     # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2 – Inside Jupyter Notebook
Run this command in a code cell:
```python
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run
Open Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells as needed for your workflow.

---

## 📈 Model Training
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets.  
- Train machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).  
- Evaluate performance using:
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-Score  
  - ROC-AUC
